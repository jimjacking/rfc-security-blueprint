# Bug Bounty Blueprint: Analyzing RFCs for Ethical Hacking Insights

## Purpose of the Project
"Bug Bounty Blueprint" is a resource designed for ethical researchers and cybersecurity professionals seeking to understand and apply the concepts of RFCs (Request for Comments) in their vulnerability research practices. This project aims to provide an in-depth insight into how RFCs impact web security and how researchers can utilize them to enhance their security testing approaches.

## Importance of RFCs
RFCs are fundamental documents that establish standards and best practices for the functioning of Internet protocols and other technical aspects. Understanding these documents allows ethical researchers to identify weaknesses in software implementations and propose appropriate solutions.
